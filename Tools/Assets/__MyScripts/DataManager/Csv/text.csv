        埃达便是这次任务的学生之一。当看到通知时，埃达和她的同学们都感到惊讶。“胆小鬼”——这是同学们给埃达起的绰号。童年妹妹的一场事故，让本来就生性胆小的埃达对血肉模糊的场景有着本能的恐惧。医学课中，吓晕厥的埃达曾被同学们嘲笑了很久。但渴望救助他人的心使得埃达逐渐克服课堂上的恐惧。\n
        或许是因为埃达获得了魔法书的认可，这是同学们最终得出的结论。在图书馆内藏有各种高深的魔法书，它们拥有自己的意志，平时躲藏在角落中，轻易无法找到，只有遇到它们认可的人选才会出现在其面前。而埃达随身都带着一本厚重的魔法书，是她在学院图书馆无意中发现的，上面记载着各种生命和治愈的奥义。\n
        不论校园中的非议，埃达还是鼓起勇气接下了任务。在完成任务之余，埃达也致力于救助所有自己见到的弱者。即便是“胆小鬼”，当无辜的人受到伤害时，埃达也会拿起的自己的法杖挺身而出。
","        Every graduate in the college is supposed to pass an examination of trials for half a year so that they can be recognized and approved by the college. The contents of trials are different and the sites are all over the continent. Of the trials, the field investigation in the battlefront is the most difficult one. Among the previous graduates, only the few with the best qualification were appointed to be on the task.\n
        Ada is one of them on the task this time. Her classmates and she were shocked at the notice. “Coward”—it is a nickname for her given by her classmates. Ada, born timid, has an instinctive fear of bloody scenes because of an accident happening to her little sister in her childhood. In the medical class, she was so scared that she fell into a coma, which made her classmates laugh at her for a long time. But she is so eager to save people that she could overcome the fear in the class gradually.\n
        The final conclusion of the classmates is maybe it's because Ada is approved by the magic book. There are all kinds of profound magic books in the library. They have their own will. They usually hide in the corner and can't be found easily. Only when they meet their approved candidates will they appear in front of them. And Ada carries a heavy magic book found by her in the library by accident. It records the profound meanings of life and healing.\n
        Despite the criticisms on campus, Ada still nerved herself to take over the task. As she dealt with the task, she was also committed to helping all the weak she saw. Even as a "coward", she will lift her wand and step forward bravely when seeing innocent people getting hurt. \n

        到达营地时已是傍晚，队员们还没来得及休整，就听到巨兽的吼叫在不远处响起。侦查的哨兵带回情报，巨兽的体积出乎意料，远远超过了先前预料的情况。\n
        以火枪团的目前的人数恐怕难以抵挡，然而放任巨兽前进，附近的村庄一定会遭到袭击。科尔决定在援军到来之前尽量拖延巨兽的前进。侥幸的是，科尔和他的队伍成功地驱赶了巨兽，但可想而知，科尔带领的火枪团在这次战斗之中死伤惨重。\n
        科尔带着残存的队员回到总部，他希望帝国能够额外追奖牺牲的战友们，以此告慰战友的亡灵。然而军队的高层并不乐意，他们坚持认为是火枪团自作主张才导致了这场事故，不但没有给予阵亡士兵应有的荣耀，还取消了伤亡抚慰金作为处罚。\n
        失去战友的悲伤与对高层的不忿使科尔离开了火枪团，带着伤痕累累的盔甲和久经战场遗留的旧伤，科尔加入了探险队，开始了他每天的巡逻生活。\n

        It was evening when they arrived at the campsite. Before the team members could take a rest, they heard the giant beast roaring from not far away. The scouts reported the beast was much more giant than they'd imagined.\n
        There might be too few musketeers to defeat the beast. However, if they just saw it move forward without doing anything, the nearby villages would surely suffer a lot. Cole decided to try their best to make the beast move less slowly before their reinforcements arrived. Fortunately, they managed to drive the beast away. But it is not hard to imagine the huge losses they suffered.\n
        Cole returned to the headquarter with the remaining members. He hoped that the Empire would reward the dead soldiers. However, the superiors of the army refused. They insisted that it was the musketeer regiment's self-assertion that led to the accident. Not only did they not award the dead soldiers the deserved honor, but also they cancelled compensation for the dead and the wounded as a punishment.\n
        The sadness of losing his comrades-in-arm and the resentment to the superiors made Cole leave the musketeer regiment. With his scarred armor and old wounds left from his long-term s, Cole joined the expedition and began his new life as a patrol.
    Cole's gun is always ready for the revenge on the giant beast.\n

        "I'm still not myself today. I'll show you next time..." Barks' big nose turned red under the light. "I can kill one with only one fireball..."\n
        As others laughed happily, Barks came to the bar and filled his own bottle with wine, then ordered another glass and began to drink on his own at ease.\n
        After drinking a couple of glasses, Barks began to chat with his friends at the bar again. After all, it's nothing more than those about how powerful his spells were and how great he was with his several apprentices on the continent in the past years. His friends couldn't tell whether it was true or not, but the old and shabby robe on him wasn't convincing at all. \n
        "It's absolutely true. Just ask Paul if you don't believe me." Barks was rather unsatisfied with the attitude of his friends, and asked a passing-by bartender to testify for him.\n
        Paul still remembered it was what this regular customer of this inn was when he came here over ten years ago. He had nothing to prove for him but his hanging out in the bar. But one day, when Barks was rarely sober, a group of robbers from other places broke into the inn. After robbing others of some money, they were ready to rob Barks of his wine bottle. Up to now, Paul still remembered that Barks later conjured numerous meteorites, beating away the robbers and also destroying the inn. \n
        "Perhaps yes. " Paul shrugged, "Maybe Barks is powerful, but it must be at the time when he is sober."\n
        When Paul finished, a crowd and Barks burst into laughter. \n

He took his wife to a remote village and lived with her over there day and night.\n

","        The Gold City holds sacrificial activities every year. As the biggest festival in the city, it is also a golden opportunity for practitioners to become transcendent. When the lengthy sacrifice of the high priest reverberated around the square in front of the temple, the practitioners selected by the Pharaoh stood still in the altar, praying for blessings of the gods. And the audience was already impatient. After all, there had been no one becoming transcendent in the city for many years. But the night carnival after the sacrifice seemed to be more worthy of anticipating.\n
        As the last word of the high priest's sacrifice was uttered, the long lost divine power covered the world suddenly. Along with screams, yellow sands held up Nefer from the altar, and the divine light from the sky surrounded the girl who was favored by the gods.\n
        Nefer is a talented practitioner, but as the Pharaoh's daughter, she is more famous for arrogance and impulsiveness. So no one expects that she will become the chosen one. Nefer felt that her soul was constantly reshaped in the divine light, and the endless power of the sun was constantly integrating into it. The sand under her feet changed into a throne, and every gravel was cheering for her.\n
       Why her? Nefer didn't understand why even when she woke up. In the divine light, she saw the guardian goddess on the mural of the temple. The goddess chose her and told her about the disaster that the continent would face. In the zone near the battlefront, the demonized creatures have been ready to move again. They need a powerful transcendent one to find the truth. That will be a very dangerous journey, and the goddess notices her determination of protecting this land.\n

Her people have the blood of ice and snow, which gives them the power of ice and snow, and also freezes their lives. It appears that they could maintain the youth, but when they grow older and older, their blood of ice and snow will become more and more powerful so that they can't control the erosion from the power. And at last they will be transformed into ice sculptures. \n
        Some of the people in the family are born with stronger blood, which means that their life expectancy will be far shorter than that of others. Gerda is one of them.\n
        Today, she is leaving her hometown in order to save herself, but also to help her people get rid of the long lasting curse. She will look for a giant beast according to a story spread in her family because only its blood can suppress the blood of her people.

Before people reacted, the treasure had disappeared, leaving only the business card with the signature of the Robin Hood Card. His main targets are the rich businessmen who are who are not benevolent  and also the vicious villains.\n

That night, the Robin Hood rushed into Taglan's nightclub in a panic. Before he said anything, a gangster after him stealthily knocked him out. The other gangsters on guard in the nightclub immediately tied up the unconscious Robin Hood for fear that he would escape again. At this time, the boss walked out of the street corner with his butler and confidants. In a good mood, he entertained all his men in the nightclub on the spot and ordered the butler to treat Morris well.\n
        The next day, when Taglan and his men woke up from hangover and unexpectedly found that the Robin Hood Card caught last night was fake. The one who was tied up turned out to be the butler with disguise. And the real Robin Hood Card, naturally, had disappeared along with the title deeds of the slum.\n

He was one of the junior captains of a private mercenary regiment with a brilliant record. In an attack on the headquarter of the mercenary regiment, he was one of the few survivors.\n

Among the equipment, there is a new weapon named "Twilight Barrier", whose thick muzzle ensures full firepower, and the energy shield aroused by the gun can absorb a large amount of damage, protecting themselves and teammates at the critical moment.\n
        When Barnard guarded the vault, a large number of infamous bandits were stopped by him and put into prison instead. But the subsequent awards from the bank could not please him since the dead teammates of the mercenary regiment often haunted in his dreams.\n
